# 3D graphics rendering 
This is an engine to render and transform the 3D object in 2D space, written on Python with OpenGL library.
Given one object representation in 3D, the engine gives the opportunity to view it projected onto a 2D screen with the transformations given from the user, such as rotations, zooming, translation, and changing light direction. 
This will be useful not only for the study purposes, but also as a fundamental step to developing the real game engine.

## What is 3D graphics rendering?  

3D rendering is the 3D computer graphics process of converting 3D models into 2D images on a computer. 
The process of rendering 3D graphics usually involves 3D modeling (lightning and texturing), the rendering itself and refining.
It has huge application in game development, as 3D-games depends on it, and all based on linear algebra fundamentals.

The project is focused around the real-time computer graphics, or real-time rendering, conceptions. It provides real-time object analysis with an interactive interface through keyboard and mouse. Using the different techniques for rendering, such as ray-tracing and rasterization, the user can respond to rendered images in real time, producing an interactive experience.
